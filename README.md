# 🧠 DSA Daily Journey  
> 90-Day Data Structures & Algorithms Practice — Notes, Problems, and Daily Progress.

---

## 🎯 Goal
Master all core DSA patterns in **90 days** — one concept at a time, with:
- Step-by-step explanations  
- Code templates (Python-first)  
- Pattern-based practice problems  
- Daily learning logs and progress tracking

## 📚 Roadmap

### **1. Arrays & Hashing (Foundation)** ⭐ *Start Here*
- [ ] Two Pointers  
- [ ] Sliding Window  
- [ ] Prefix Sum  

---

### **2. Strings (Similar to Arrays)**
- [ ] Pattern Matching  
- [ ] String Manipulation  

---

### **3. Linked Lists**
- [ ] Fast & Slow Pointers  
- [ ] Reversal Techniques  

---

### **4. Stacks & Queues**
- [ ] Stack Basics  
- [ ] Monotonic Stack / Queue  
- [ ] Expression Parsing  
- [ ] Queue Implementations  

📁 **Notes:**  
- `stack_notes.md` → Concept, patterns, and intuition  
- `stack_implementation.md` → Python implementations (`list`, `deque`, `class`)  
- Practice order: `Valid Parentheses → Min Stack → NGE → Histogram`

---

### **5. Trees (Intro to Graphs)**
- [ ] DFS (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder)  
- [ ] BFS (Level Order)  
- [ ] Binary Search Trees (Insert / Search / Delete)  

---

### **6. Graphs** ⭐ *Your Current Problem*
- [ ] DFS Traversal  
- [ ] BFS Traversal  
- [ ] Shortest Path (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)  
- [ ] Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal, Prim)  
- [ ] Topological Sort  
- [ ] Union Find (Disjoint Set)  

---

### **7. Dynamic Programming (Advanced)**
- [ ] 1D DP (Climbing Stairs, House Robber, etc.)  
- [ ] 2D DP (Knapsack, Grid Paths)  
- [ ] DP on Trees / Graphs  

---

### **8. Backtracking**
- [ ] Permutations / Combinations  
- [ ] Constraint Satisfaction Problems (Sudoku, N-Queens)  

---

### **9. Greedy Algorithms**
- [ ] Interval Scheduling  
- [ ] Activity Selection / Merging Intervals  

---
